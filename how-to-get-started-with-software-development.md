There are a number of steps that can be taken before anything is even coded.
First, and perhaps most importantly, the founding team should conduct market research and understand user problems, needs, and the existing products that solve those needs.
Next, identify ways in which the problem(s) and need(s) can be better served, either in terms of quality of service, available features, price, or a combination of these factors.
Identify different user segments and create personas. This will allow the team to understand how different types of customers can be served, and consequently, what the product should look like to serve each of those customers.
With personas and user stories defined, specify the user requirements and what each action necessitates and returns. 
Create a rough picture of the product on one platform first, before planning to build for all platforms (i.e. desktop before mobile). Low-fidelity prototypes will allow for nimbleness to shift strategies at this early stage.
Even with this gameplan laid out, the team should assess the general risks of launching, specifically in terms of competition, ability to deliver the product as specified to the user (i.e. execution risk), and ability to finance the entire operation in the short-term (before raising money).
