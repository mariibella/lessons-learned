Project Collaboration Inside and Outside the Office

Collaborating with programmers and designers can be difficult at times; especially when you are creating
a new product that you have envisioned in your mind and need to relay it to those actually building it.
One important aspect of this is how and when you communicate with your programmers and designers, since
many times they may not be next to you as they are actually building the product. In addition, the question
of when it is appropriate to talk to them becomes an issue since you do not want to disrupt their work
when they are focused. Therefore it is important to understand the signs of when not to bother or give
input on the product that is being developed, and rather to wait until they are actually done.

When programmers are in the office, it is important to set ground rules on when and how to communicate
with them. This could mean that they are in work mode when their headphones are on, and no one should
both them at that point, or it could be as simple as having a red ping pong paddle up next to them. These
simple efforts allow the programmers to be more productive, and then give you designated time to actually
give comments and ask questions rather than interrupting the work flow completely.

When programmers are not on site, it is a different story. In today's world programmers will work from
home at times, or be away from you when one of you is traveling. Therefore it becomes necessary to have
a way to communicate when not on location. One way to do this is through [Slack](https://slack.com/) or [Skype](http://www.skype.com/en/), both allow for
text conversations that are then recorded. Slack is better in many respects, however if you need to see
facial expressions or hear changes in tone, then Skype or a [Google Hangout](https://plus.google.com/hangouts) might be a better bet since
this will allow you to actually see the person or people you are talking to. However, the dilemma is that
you cannot work while these conversations are going on. It is important to set norms with programmers 
early so that you can decide which way to communicate and when it is appropriate to do so. In addition,
GitHub is another way for programmers to work remotely and allows for each person to see what others are 
working on and how everything is progressing.

In all, you are trying to avoid this when taking the above steps:
